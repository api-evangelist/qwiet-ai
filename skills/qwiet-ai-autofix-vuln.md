# AutoFix

Uses **slmcp** AutoFix APIs. Requires **app** and finding ids from triage (`top_actionable[].id`). If MCP tools are missing, run `/setup-harness-code-security-mcp` first. MCP setup: [mcp-setup.md](references/mcp-setup.md).

## When to run this skill

The user (or you) must invoke **`/autofix-vuln`** so this file is loaded. Some hosts prefix skills, for example `/harness-sast-and-sca:autofix-vuln`. If they ask for autofix or "recommended fixes" after triage **without** a slash command, **invoke this skill** first — do **not** jump straight to `sl_request_finding_fix` / `sl_get_recommended_fixes` from the prior turn's context alone.

Prerequisite: **`/triage-vuln`** should have produced **`top_actionable`** ids. If not, re-run **`sl_list_findings`** for the scan and read **`top_actionable[].id`**.

## Which findings to fix

Fix **all** `top_actionable` ids from triage unless the user narrows scope — **SAST, SCA, and OSS risk** (including `pkg:...` titles). Use the same Qwiet AutoFix path for every id.

Collect ids from **`top_actionable[].id`** only — never from prose summaries.

## AutoFix workflow (request → poll → apply)

Prefer **generating** fixes on the platform, not only reading stale recommendations.

### 1. Request fixes (write)

For each finding id (or any id with no ready fix yet), call **`sl_request_finding_fix`** with `{ "app": "...", "finding": "..." }`.

You may batch requests in parallel (one tool call per finding).

### 2. Poll until ready

Poll **`sl_get_recommended_fixes`** in batches of up to **5** ids: `{ "app": "...", "findings": ["id1", "id2", ...] }`.

- Repeat until every finding has **`apply_mode`** **`ready`** or **`partial`**, or **`status`** indicates failure.
- Between polls, use a short wait (e.g. Bash `sleep 3`) — fixes are async on the platform.
- If **`apply_mode`** is **`markdown_only`**, ensure **`WORKSPACE_FOLDER`** (or **`CURSOR_WORKSPACE_FOLDER`**) points at the scanned repo root and poll again.

**Single finding:** **`sl_get_recommended_fix`** with `{ "app": "...", "finding": "..." }`.

### 3. Apply fixes automatically

When **`apply_mode`** is **`ready`**, each finding includes **`edits[]`**:

- **`file`** — path relative to the workspace root
- **`old_string`** / **`new_string`** — exact strings for your file **Edit** tool

**Do not** paste the fix as markdown and ask whether to apply — apply **`edits[]`** directly (same file: apply **bottom-to-top** by `start_line` so offsets stay valid).

If **`apply_mode`** is **`partial`**, apply available **`edits[]`** and use **`fix_markdown`** for the rest.

If Qwiet returns no applicable AutoFix after polling, summarize **`fix_markdown`** / **`fix_notes`** when present and note the finding for manual follow-up in the Qwiet app — do **not** substitute `npm audit`, `npm audit fix`, or other non-Qwiet dependency tooling unless the user explicitly asks outside this skill.

## Branch AutoFixes

**`sl_list_branch_autofixes`** with `{ "app": "...", "branch": "..." }` (compact summary by default)

Default branch from git when omitted.

## After fixes

- Apply **`edits[]`** for every finding that returned them; summarize what changed
- Suggest **`/run-security-scan`** to verify — do not commit unless the user explicitly asks

## Workflow order (reference)

1. **`/run-security-scan`** — `sl_analyze`, brief summary, save `scan_id`
2. **`/triage-vuln`** — `top_actionable`, dataflows, ranked list
3. **`/autofix-vuln`** — this skill
